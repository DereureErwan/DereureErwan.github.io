title: About me
---

I am currently looking for a PostDoc position in Image Processing and Applied Mathematics. I am especially interested in Biomedical Imaging and Remote Sensing.

Before that, I completed my PhD in Biomedical Image Analysis under the supervision of Christophe Kervazo, Elsa Angelini (**IMAGES** group, Télécom Paris) and Jean-Christophe Olivo-Marin (**BIA Unit**, Institut Pasteur). I worked on optimization based methods for **Blind Source Separation applied on Bioluminescent Imaging** and on strengthening the **robustness of the quantification** of these images to improve experimental protocols.

I received both my M.Sc. degree in Applied Mathematics and Computer science from CentraleSupélec, France and my M.Sc. in Fundamental and Applied Mathematics from the University of Lorraine, France, in 2020.
